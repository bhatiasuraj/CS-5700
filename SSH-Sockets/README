High Level Approach:
1. Imported libraries socket, ssl and sys.
2. Defined host and port that are used to create our client socket.
3. The sys library is used to get parameters from the command line by the function sys.arg[].
4. Mentioned all combinations of command line inputs that can be given to run the code with or without use of SSL.
5. Printed error for any incorrect command line syntax input.
6. Sending a HELLO message to the server in order to get the STATUS.
7. Identifying the numbers and operator and performating mathematical operators to send it back to the server.
8. The above step is run in a while loop infinitely until the server sends a BYE message with the secret flag.
9. The secret flag is identified for connection with and without use of SSL.
10.Permission to execute the python file is included in the Makefile..


Challenges faced:
1. Modifying the code to run the command line syntax exactly the way it was mentioned.
2. Error-handling.

Overview of testing code:
1. Modifying the code to run exactly as the given syntax.
2. This included many possibilities as the program could be executed by combination of  options such as the -s parameter, -p port number and also without any options.
3. The case for -p port number paramter would not be executed for a half-complete syntax i.e. the port number has to mentioned to run the code succesfully.
4. We also added a possibility of printing an error message in case of a wrongly entered paramters.
5. After testing the code for different options, the output of the operations and the secret flag was noted for each of them.
6. To execute the python file from any machine, a Makefile is created.
